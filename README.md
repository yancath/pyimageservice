# :snake: Python Image Upload Service

# :computer: Technical Profile
This personal project is written in Python specifically the Tornado web application library. My goal is to learn how to implemnent back end services, and create RESTful APIs to be consumed.

# :heavy_check_mark: Learning Outcomes Achieved
- How to implement POST and GET requests
- Basic front end development supplemented with basic back end service

# :notebook_with_decorative_cover: How It Works
Essentially choose a file, upload and a link appears. You can put the link into the browser and hit enter to see the image you appear. As well, the image you've uploaded will be found in the /img folder!

# :triangular_flag_on_post: Challenges Faced
- Self taught in Python years ago, this was an exercise for myself to see how to use Python in a more applicable way other than object oriented programming exercises
- Static file handling (adding the CSS file) isn't the most easiest to do in Tornado, it is recommended to use nginx, but I managed to get it to work

# :gem: Future Features
- Add extra CSS/animations to spice up the page!
- Have it output the actual photo uploaded on the page in place of Pinky the ghost from Pac Man
